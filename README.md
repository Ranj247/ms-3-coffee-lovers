# [Coffee Lovers](https://ms-3-coffee-lovers.herokuapp.com/)

Coffee Lovers is a website where users can view coffee brewing recipes and contribute by sharing their own recipes on the website for other users. This website has been created for my third milestone project as part of the Diploma in Full Stack Software Development course with Code Institute. The website is responsive on all device sizes.

## Overview
This is a Coffee Lovers page, which has been designed solely for coffee lovers who would like to find and share their own coffee brewing recipes with other members of the community. This website has been built for my third milestone project which is part of the Code Isntitute's FullStack Software Development Diploma Course, and the main focus is to build a full-stack website allowing users to manage a common dataset. This project demonstrates the skills and knowledge of using the HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Python,the Flask framework, Jinja templating language and MongoDB in Back-End development which I have learned recently on the course.

The aim of the project is to create a coffee brewing recipes website keeping in mind the CRUD functionalities: Create, Read, Update, and Delete recipes from the database. Upon registration, the user will be able to view their profile, create new recipes, update and delete their own recipes at any time. The website is created using the Materialize CSS responsive designing which provide a better user experience from mobile devices to tablets or larger screens.The website was created for educational purposes.

## User Experience
This website would advance the user's goals by providing CRUD functionality to the coffee recipes database. It advances the site owner's goals by being a regular user of the site themselves.

The User Experience for this site was planned & developed using the [5 Planes of UX Design](https://www.geeksinux.com/the-elements-of-user-experience-design/): Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton, Surface.

### Strategy
#### User Stories

- As a first-time visitor to the website, I want to:
    - explore all the coffee recipes on the website added by different users.
    - use the search functionality to narrow down favourite recipes using the keywords.
    - contribute to the website by adding own favourite coffee recipes. 
    - experience easier registration process.

- As a returning visitor to the website, I want to:

    - Search for recipes by keyword.
    - Login to my account to see recipes I have added.
