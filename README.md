# [Coffee Lovers](https://ms-3-coffee-lovers.herokuapp.com/)

Coffee Lovers is a website where users can view coffee brewing recipes and contribute by sharing their own recipes on the website for other users. This website has been created for my third milestone project as part of the Diploma in Full Stack Software Development course with Code Institute. The website is responsive on all device sizes.
