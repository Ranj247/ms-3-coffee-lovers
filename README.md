# [Coffee Lovers](https://ms-3-coffee-lovers.herokuapp.com/)

Coffee Lovers is a website where users can view coffee brewing recipes and contribute by sharing their own recipes on the website for other users. This website has been created for my third milestone project as part of the Diploma in Full Stack Software Development course with Code Institute. The website is responsive on all device sizes.

## Overview
This is a Coffee Lovers page, which has been designed solely for coffee lovers who would like to find and share their own coffee brewing recipes with other members of the community. This website has been built for my third milestone project which is part of the Code Instituteâ€™s FullStack Software Development Diploma Course, and the main focus is to build a full-stack website allowing users to manage a common dataset. This project demonstrates the skills and knowledge of using the HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Python, Flask framework, Jinja templating language and MongoDB in Back-End development which I have learned recently on the course.

The aim of the project is to create a coffee brewing recipes website keeping in mind the CRUD functionalities: Create, Read, Update, and Delete recipes from the database. Upon registration, the user will be able to view their profile, create new recipes, update and delete their own recipes at any time. The website is created using the Materialize CSS responsive designing which provide a better user experience from mobile devices to tablets or larger screens. The website was created for educational purposes.

***

## User Experience
This website would advance the user's goals by providing CRUD functionality to the coffee recipes database. It advances the site owner's goals by being a regular user of the site themselves.

The User Experience for this site was planned & developed using the [5 Planes of UX Design](https://www.geeksinux.com/the-elements-of-user-experience-design/): Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton, Surface.

### Strategy
#### User Stories

- As a first-time visitor to the website, I want to:
    - explore all the coffee recipes on the website added by different users.
    - use the search functionality to narrow down favourite recipes using the keywords.
    - contribute to the website by adding own favourite coffee recipes. 
    - experience easier registration process.

- As a returning visitor to the website, I want to:
    - explore all the coffee recipes on the website added by different users.
    - Search for recipes by keyword.
    - Login to my account to see recipes I have added.
    - Edit and Delete recipes that I have added.
    - Contact the site admin to request the addition of new brew methods.

- As the site owner, I want to:
    - Log in to the website as an admin account.
    - Create, Edit, and Delete coffee brewing recipes.
    - Create, Edit, and Delete coffee brew method categories.

### Scope

After an account is created, a flash message appears on the screen to showcase that the registration being successful and now the new user would be able to contribute by adding their favourite coffee brewing recipes. 
- Login/Logout:
    - The Login/Logout functionality adds authentication for registered users, allowing them to access, edit, and delete their own recipes. Allows users to logout by clearing the "session" cookie.
- Profile:
    - The Profile functionality provides registered & logged in users to see their own recipes (if any recipe created), add more recipes, edit or delete their existing recipes.

- Manage Brew Methods:
    - The Manage Brew Methods functionality provides the Admin of the site to view all of the coffee brew methods.
- Add Brew Method:
    - The Add Brew Method functionality provides a input field where the site admin can add new coffee brew method.

## Deployment
### Local Deployment

The following dependencies will need to be installed in order to run this application locally:
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads) to run the application.
- [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing) to install app requirements.
- [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) or any preferred IDE, such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for cloning and version control.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) to create a database using MongoDB Atlas.

Follow the below steps for local deployment:

1. Clone the GitHub repository by entering the following command into the Git terminal:
    - `git clone https://github.com/Ranj247/ms-3-coffee-lovers.git`
2. After cloning the project, create an `env.py` file that includes the below code, replacing the `SECRET_KEY`, `MONGO_URI`, `MONGO_DBNAME` with your own credentials:
```
import os
os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "YOUR_SECRET_KEY")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "YOUR_MONGO_URI")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "coffee_lovers")
```
3. Create a `.gitignore` file and add the `env.py` file to the list of files.
4. Install all requirements from the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Ranj247/ms-3-coffee-lovers/blob/main/requirements.txt) file using this command:
    - `pip3 -r requirements.txt`
5. Sign up for a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) account, and create a new Database called `coffee_lovers`. The collections in that database should be structured as follows:

**coffee_brew_methods**
```
_id: <ObjectId>
method_name: <string>
```

**recipes**
```
_id: <ObjectId>
recipe_method: <string>
roast_level: <string>
grind_of_bean: <string>
quantity_of_coffee: <string>
brew_time: <string>
recipe_description: <string>
created_by: <string>
```

**users**
```
_id: <ObjectId>
username: <string>
password: <string>
```

6. Run the app using the following command in the terminal:
    - `python3 app.py`

### Remote Deployment

To deploy this app on Heroku, the following steps were taken:

1. Create a `requirements.txt` file so Heroku can install the required dependencies.
    - `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
    - This project's requirements.txt file can be seen [here](https://github.com/Ranj247/ms-3-coffee-lovers/blob/main/requirements.txt).
2. Create a `Procfile` with information about the type of app that will be deployed.
